## Contributing new languages

We love contributions, if you're keen to get your language supported by Kinde, here are the steps to do so:

1. Fork this repo.

2. Please create a new directory named the languages code ( codes can be found in the table below).

For example, if you were adding Amharic you would do so in a new directory called `am`.

3. Copy our base `auth.json` from `en` into your new directory and update translations for all relevant values.

Where you see ${some_text} this is variable text our system automatically generates, you do not need to translate it, but need to include the variable in the correct order in your translation.

4. Validate your file(s) using the following steps:

   1. Run `npm run validate` which will check all files against our json schema to make sure all keys are accounted for.
   2. Run `npm run validate --file=en/auth.json` to check a single file.

5. Once you have completed translating the preferred language (e.g.`en/auth.json`) and passed validation checks, please mark it as done by copying this checkmark (✅) and placing it in the "Status" column of the table for your translated language in the README.md file.

6. Make a PR from your fork back to this repo. In the PR comment, under Explain your changes, describe what language you added, changed, or fixed. Additionally, please describe briefly your experiences with translation (e.g. links to previous work).

7. When in doubt, please refer to Kinde’s [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/kinde-oss/.github/blob/489e2ca9c3307c2b2e098a885e22f2239116394a/CONTRIBUTING.md).
