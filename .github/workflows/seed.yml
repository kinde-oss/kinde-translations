    # Granular permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN
    # This is important for security to follow the principle of least privilege.
    # 'contents: write' is needed for the script to be able to commit and push changes.
    # If you only want to check and report, change 'contents: write' to 'contents: read'.
    permissions:
      contents: write # Allows writing to the repository (for git add, commit, push)
      pull-requests: write # Allows commenting on PRs (if you add logic for that later)
      # Other permissions default to 'none' if not explicitly listed
